Practice 1: Data Handling and Visualization
Introduction
In this practice, various Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib are used to read, analyze, and visualize data from the Iris Setosa dataset. The goal is to learn how to handle and graphically represent information to facilitate its analysis.

Exercises
Load and visualize the first records of the dataset.
Obtain descriptive statistics of the dataset.
Detect and handle null values.
Create bar, pie, and scatter plots to analyze the characteristics of Iris species.
Practice 2: Bayesian Classifier
Introduction
A Bayesian classifier is developed to classify images based on specific regions. Using statistical values such as mean and covariance, patterns in images are predicted.

Objective
Classify images with 2, 3, or 4 regions using the Bayesian classifier.

Methodology
Load and preprocess images.
Create masks for object classes in the images.
Calculate statistics (mean and covariance) for the classes.
Implement pixel classification based on a Gaussian model.
Final Project: Face Recognition with PCA
Introduction
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for facial reconstruction and recognition. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

Methodology
Load and preprocess face images.
Detect faces using Haar Cascade classifiers.
Standardize training data.
Calculate the covariance matrix and decompose it into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Select the first principal components and project the images into a new space.
Reconstruct the images from the principal components.
Evaluate the reconstruction quality using the mean squared error (MSE).
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks
Introduction
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is implemented to classify images in an animal dataset. CNNs are effective in computer vision tasks due to their ability to process data with a grid-like structure.

Architecture
3 convolutional layers with 32, 64, and 128 filters, ReLu activation function.
Maxpooling layers, flatten, dense, and dropout layers.
Use of data augmentation to improve training.
Training and Evaluation
Use data generators for training and validation.
Evaluate the model using Keras' evaluate method to calculate accuracy and loss.
Basic Image Handling
Introduction
More than 100 image formats, such as JPEG, PNG, DICOM, NIfTI, TIFF, and others, are explored. Handling these formats is performed using various Python modules and packages to extract and manipulate useful data.

Exercises
Open and display images using libraries such as Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-Image, and PIL.
Obtain image information such as extension, size, and data type.
Change the color space of images.
Display images in different color channels.
Convert images to grayscale and perform size reduction operations.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive view of various pattern recognition and data analysis techniques and tools in Python. From basic image handling to the implementation of complex models like CNNs and PCA, it covers multiple essential aspects for developing computer vision and machine learning applications.
